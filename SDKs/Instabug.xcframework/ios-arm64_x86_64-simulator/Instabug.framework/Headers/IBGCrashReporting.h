 @brief A callback function that instructs Instabug to await user confirmation before sending crash reports. This callback specifically applies
 to fatal errors (crashes), force restart and out-of-memory (OOM) reports, excluding app hangs and non-fatals errors.

 If no response is received within a 2-minute window, the callback triggers a timeout mechanism, preventing the automatic sending of the crash report.
 
 @Note This callback is designed to enhance user privacy and control by giving them the option to approve or decline the submission of crash reports, ensuring a more transparent and user-centric experience.

 @property onWillSendCrashReportHandler
   A class property that accepts an IBGCrashType representing the crash type and
   an IBGCrashReportConsentReplyHandler block for managing crash report consent.

 Objective c Example usage:
 @code
   IBGCrashReporting.onWillSendCrashReportHandler = ^(IBGCrashType crashType, IBGCrashReportConsentReplyHandler completionHandler) {
       // Your implementation to handle crash report consent and sending mechanism
   };
 @endcode

 Swift Example usage:
 @code
     CrashReporting.onWillSendCrashReportHandler = { (crashType, completionHandler) in
         // Your implementation to handle crash report consent and sending mechanism
     }
 @endcode
